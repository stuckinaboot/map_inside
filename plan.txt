Idea: An iOS app that is used to create indoor floor plans for buildings. These floor plans will then be uploaded to the cloud and will be explorable on a web platform.

Floor plan: In the context of this project, a floor plan is the path recorded by the user traveling around a given floor (we can maybe normalize small curves in the users path), with special points of interest (as determined by the user) marked.

Purpose: 
There are really two main purposes for this app, one of them coming from personal experience -
1) Allow anyone to create a floor plan for a building. This would make navigating buildings with many rooms (or many points of interest easier).
2) Allow people to create personal floor plans (not uploaded to the cloud) for following certain paths in buildings. Such as the path from entrance to a certain doctor’s office (this tends to be complicated in places like NYC where there are many floors and rooms).

Main Difficulty Worth Mentioning that We Will Disregard for Now: Accounting for elevators/stairs. Stairs is easier because iOS accounts for that (although I’m not sure how accurate it is). For now, we should just use one floor and we can add the multi-floor ability in the future.

iOS App: The user’s path will be recorded via an iOS app. Prior to using the app, the user will need to take n = 20 (n can be changed) steps outside so that we can calibrate the distance traveled (according to the gps) with the number of steps taken. We can decide if this is a one-time thing or if it should be repeated each time (due to varying gps signal strengths). Before the user enters the building, he will press a button marking his location so that the app knows the building (or in the beginning just the lat/long coordinates) for the floor-plan. The user’s path will be computed by taking the number of steps on the built-in pedometer and by analyzing his compass direction. Once the user finishes his path, he will be able to look at the computed floor-plan (possibly as an image or possibly as a JSON file displayed nicely as an image). Then, when he is finished, he presses upload and file will be sent to the cloud.
* If time permits, could save for offline use. If time permits, could allow user to download floor plans from the cloud.

The Cloud: AWS backend (unless you guys have other suggestions, this is the only cloud backend I am familiar with). I’ve done stuff with AWS but am not fully sure of optimal structure for what I am about to say next. I can talk to my dad about this. My current suggestion: a database where the keys are general latitude and longitudes (we’d have to look at the numbers, but maybe enough for a 1/2 mile by 1/2 mile square) and then values are another key-value pair where the key = latitude/longitude which is much more specific and the value = the actual floor plan (probably stored as a JSON file or an image).
* Note: My suggestion comes from my completely ignorant view of how we would get a google maps overlay to show pins for floor plans (as described in the next step)

Web Platform: NodeJS. There could be two versions to this. The first one is just so we can have something to show if we can’t get the second one working.
1) Have a list of all available floor plans and when a user selects one, he can view the floor plan and the location where the floor plan was taken
2) Build a Google Maps overlay and place pins (or some marker) where floor plans were taken, and when the user clicks the pin/marker a popover of some sort displays the floor plan.
