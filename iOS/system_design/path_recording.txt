Goal:
1) Get average user stride length by taking average stride length outside over a period of n = (some number) steps
2) Get user’s compass direction
3) Get number of steps user takes
4) Generate floor plan representation file based off the previous data

System Design:

*May need to put this on a background thread (if we want to work with marking points of interest while continuing to move), we’ll see*

classes:
FloorPlanManager
CompassManager
PedometerManager

FloorPlanBackendManager design:
Instance of CompassManager
Instance of PedometerManager
Public Method startRecordingPath
Public Method markPointOfInterest -> Takes in name and description of the point of interest as parameters
Public Function stopRecordingPath -> returns the JSON object (not a file, a JSON object) representing the path, following the specifications of floor_plan_output.format.txt

CompassManager:
Public void startRecordingDirection -> Begins recording the user’s direction.
Public void stopRecordingDirection -> Stops recording the user’s direction
Delegate method directionReported -> Reports the user’s direction to the delegate
Public Function getCurrentDirection -> Returns the current direction as an angle, where north is 0 degrees, east is 90 degrees, south is 180 degrees, etc.

PedometerManager:
Public bool startRecordingSteps -> Begins recording the user’s steps. Returns true if step counting is available (not all iOS devices have it). Takes in CMPedometerHandler block as input. This block should relay step information to the delegate.
Public void stopRecordingSteps -> Stops recording the user’s steps
