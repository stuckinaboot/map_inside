Purpose: To provide a format for representing floor plans, such that the format could easily be interpreted on any platform capable of interpreting JSON.

Format:

{
  "stride_length": some stride length in meters,
  "path": [
		angle of step 1 (all angles in radians), 
		angle of step 2, 
		angle of step 3,
		{“Name of point of interest (located at the location of step 3)”: “description of point of interest”},
		angle of step 4, 
		...
	   ],
  "location": {
    "latitude": some latitude as a double,
    "longitude": some longitude as a double
  },
  “name”: “some name for the floor plan”
}

Ex:

{
  "stride_length": 0.5424,
  "path": [
		0.00102, 
		0.00212, 
		0.00122,
		1.5821,
		1.58932,
		{“Rajivs Cafe”: “A great place to eat a great meal as you conquer the world”},
		1.58912, 
		...
	   ],
  "location": {
    "latitude": 37.090240,
    "longitude": -95.712891
  },
  “name”: “Rajivs secret lair”
}
